#Cache Out

Cache Out is my own rendition of the popular trading app Robinhood. New users can start with up to $10 million in cash, buy or sell shares in over 8,000 various companies and securities, track their performance with real-time market data, and make informed decisions with interactive company graphs and metrics.

Here's a link to the [live site](https://cache-out.herokuapp.com/#/)

Cache Out is my own rendition of the popular financial asset trading app Robinhood. New users can start with up to $10 million in cash, buy or sell stock in any company traded on the Nasdaq or NYSE, track the valuation of your portfolio with real-time market data, and make informed decisions with interactive company graphs and metrics.

Here's a link to the [live site](https://cache-out.herokuapp.com/#/)
